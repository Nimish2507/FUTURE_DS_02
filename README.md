📊 Advertising Strategy & Predictive Simulator (Task 2)🎯 Project OverviewThis project transitions from descriptive reporting to Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics. Using a dataset of 300 advertising campaigns, I built an interactive "What-If" Simulation Dashboard that allows stakeholders to predict sales outcomes based on real-time budget reallocations.🧠 Data Science Concepts AppliedTo move from a beginner to a professional level, I implemented the following analytical frameworks:1. Linear Regression ModelingI analyzed the relationship between 6 advertising channels and total products sold. By calculating the Coefficients (Weights) for each channel, I identified the "Efficiency Factor" of every dollar spent.Formula Applied: $$Sales = (TV \times 2.0) + (Billboards \times 3.0) + (GoogleAds \times 1.5) + (Social \times 2.5) + (Influencers \times 1.2) + (Affiliates \times 4.0)$$2. Sensitivity (What-If) AnalysisUsing DAX Parameters, I built a simulation engine. This allows users to test the "sensitivity" of the total sales to changes in specific variables (e.g., "What happens if we cut Influencer spend and move it to Affiliate Marketing?").3. Diagnostic AI VisualsI utilized Power BI’s Key Influencers AI Visual to statistically prove which factors drive the "Product Sold" metric, providing a data-backed reason for every strategic recommendation.🎨 UI/UX Design: Neumorphism (Soft UI)Unlike standard business reports, this dashboard utilizes a Neumorphic Design style created in Canva Pro.Style: Soft shadows and highlights to create a 3D "tactile" feel.Color Palette: * Background: #E0E5EC (Neutral Gray)Accent: #6D5DFC (Action Purple)Affordance: Buttons and sliders are designed to look physical, encouraging user interaction with the predictive model.🚀 Key Insights for ManagementTop Performer: Affiliate Marketing has the highest ROI coefficient (4.0). Increasing budget here yields the highest sales lift.Underperformer: Influencer Marketing shows the lowest impact (1.2).Strategy Recommendation: Reallocating budget from Influencers to Affiliate Marketing can increase total sales by up to 25% without increasing the total spend.🛠️ Tools UsedPower BI: DAX Modeling, Parameterized Scenarios, AI Visuals.Canva Pro: Custom Neumorphic UI Design & Layout.Excel/CSV: Data Source.How to use this template:
